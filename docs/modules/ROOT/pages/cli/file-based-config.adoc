= File Based Configuration

File-based configuration is used to set command flags. Flag values do not need to be entered on a regular basis. The file is read on Kamel startup and the flags are set accordingly.

To configure this flag, create a file named kamel-config.yaml on the same directory as your integration. The file must contain a yaml structure as shown in ./kamel-config.yaml.
